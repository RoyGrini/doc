# Introduction to NAIS

## Getting started with NAIS

If you are unfamiliar with NAIS and how to deploy your applications, the [Getting started](basics/access.md) section will get you up to speed.
You can get [a birds eye view]() of the most essential platform components and concepts [here]()

## Why NAIS exists

When you have a large development organisation, providing the developers with turn-key solutions for their most common needs can be a good investment.

This includes \(but not limited to\) [logging](observability/logs/), [metrics](observability/metrics.md), [alerts](observability/alerts/), [deployment](deployment/), [operators](/basics/operators/) and a runtime environment (across [on-prem](clusters/on-premises.md) and [GCP](clusters/gcp.md)).

Within each of these aspects, we leverage open source projects best suited for our needs and provide them with usable abstractions, sane defaults and the required security hardening.

## Contact the NAIS team

The team can be found on [Slack](https://nav-it.slack.com/messages/C5KUST8N6/).

### Would your team like to work more closely with NAIS?
If your team would like closer follow-up for a period (or permanently), we would happily dedicate someone from NAIS as your NAM(s) - short for "NAIS Account Managers".
This means we will create a dedicated Slack channel for NAIS/team-communication and have meetings if required to discuss your concerns, issues, or wishes for the platform.
