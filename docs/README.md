# Introduction to NAIS

NAIS is an application platform built to increase development speed by providing our developers at NAV with the best possible tools to develop and run their applications. 

## Why NAIS exists

When you have a large development organisation, providing the developers with turn-key solutions for their most common needs can be a good investment.

This includes \(but not limited to\) [logging](observability/logs/), [metrics](observability/metrics.md), [alerts](observability/alerts/), [deployment](deployment/), [operators](/basics/operators/) and a runtime environment (across [on-prem](clusters/on-premises.md) and [GCP](clusters/gcp.md)).

Within each of these aspects, we leverage open source projects best suited for our needs and provide them with usable abstractions, sane defaults and the required security hardening.

## Getting started with NAIS

If you are unfamiliar with NAIS and how to deploy your applications, the [Getting started](basics/access.md) section will get you up to speed.
