# Teams

We build NAIS for the development teams.

We believe that a team should be able to take full responsibility for what they build - in the entirety of its lifecycle. 
This creates better software and happier teams.

To achieve this, we ensure that each team has their own space where they can experiment, develop and host the stuff they build.
Here they have the full set of permissions, and are only limited by their own imagination.
